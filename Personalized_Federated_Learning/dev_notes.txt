If norm=False --> blows up
If norm=False but lambdas are set to 599 report and PCA is used, still blows up (but not as fast)
Default but lambdas E=1e-2 and D=1e-3 still eventually blows up (trained clients(?) blow up huge... or otherwise just some of the clients blow up... not sure which)
Default but lambdas E=1 and D=0.1 still blows up
Default but join ratio = 0.5, with PCA=10

ALSO VARY BIAS=TRUE
--> Outperforms bias=False

Explore effect of changing JR

Reparam lambdas?
Reparam learning rate?
Reparam batch size?
Reparam number of epochs?



JOIN RATIO SHOULD HAVE NO EFFECT FOR LOCAL ALGO!!! ALL CLIENTS RUN AT ONCE!!!
