'''
This implementation is based on the original Learn++ algorithm and can be used for regression tasks. The LearnPPRegressor class takes a base_estimator argument that should be an instance of a scikit-learn regressor. The n_estimators argument specifies the number of estimators to use in the ensemble. The beta argument controls the weighting of each estimator in the ensemble.

To use this implementation, you can create an instance of LearnPPRegressor and call its fit method with your training data. You can then call its predict method to make predictions on new data.
