Current Goals
1. Conduct ML Attack on filtered EMG data
2. Want to show that as the decoder progresses, accuracy increases (thus the decoder learns and personalizes)
3. Want to show that as the EMG data progresses, there is no change in accuracy 

To Do List
1. Implement Dec ML model on 2nd dec from each trial
2. Repeat the above but using the last dec from each trial
3. Momona Slack: EMG attack: 
- Down sample: Make an envelope via moving average / RMS, 100 ms windows, no overlap
- PCA on channels across all channels are participants, goal is to decrease the number of channels
- Looking for 3-6 significant axes to apply actual ML model on 
4. Put my ML pipeline into a .py file so it's standardized

Misc \ Low priority
- Do we need to worry about num_samples >> num_features?
- What is the smallest number of EMG data points we need in order to uniquely identify someone?
- Can we still uniquely identify people from their EMG's aggregate statistics
- EMG data should be highly unique, so in what ways can we leverage this or find new attack surfaces?
